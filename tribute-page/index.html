            <p>Jesus Christ performed many great deeds during his life. He had many followers and He taught thousands of people about God, and the duties and responsibilities that come with it. He performed countless miracles and other acts that no other human being could possibly do.</p>

            <p>Jesus defeated death with His resurrection, three days after He was crucified. He gave strength to his apostles to continue preaching the Word. Most importantly, His resurrection promises us that <em>we, too, can defeat the death caused by sin so that we may have eternal life.</em></p>
            <p>May God be praised!</p>
